Welcome to my analysis of the data captured using a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. The raw data can be downloaded at.

Unzip the file and place the inner folder "UCI HAR Dataset" in your R/RStudio's working directory. 

Also, place the run_analysis.R file in your working directory.

This analysis requires the reshape2 package. Please install and load the package.
